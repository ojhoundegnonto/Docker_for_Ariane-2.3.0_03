These Matlab routines come without garanty of results.
They are available in the Ariane package just to help the
Ariane users to create their own Matlab routines to plot 
lagangian diagnostics.
However these Matlab routines have been tested 
on OPA/NEMO, ROMS and Symphonie Ariane outputs.
<-adding-> NG january 2019: routines are adapted to Mars3d specifications.

They have been developped and tested with Matlab 7
on Linux platform.
<-adding-> NG january 2019: tested with Matlab 2016b.

===========
= WARNING =
===========
Sometimes Matlab plots on screen are incomplet.
Please, before to say that these routines don't work,
verify the plot save in the *.tif or *.jpeg file.

=============
= IMPORTANT =
=============
1/ m_map has to be intalled to use these matlab routines.

<-adding-> NG january 2019: don't forget to also download and install ETOOPO2 and GSHHS!

2/ You can change the projection before to submit:
    - a_mask_land
    - a_psi family routines
    - a_scat family routines
    - a_traj family routines

   By default the projection is 'mercator', but you can select:
    - projection='mercator'
    - projection='stereographic'
    - projection='lamber'
    - projection='oblique'
    - projection='miller'
    - projection='UMT'  (doesn't work !!!)
    - projection='hammer'

3/ Read "HOWTO_change_attributs.txt" to know how to change 
   a global attribut in a netcdf file. It could be needed 
   when the file directories are not the same than during 
   the computing. --- NCO is required ---

================
= QUANTITATIVE =
================
a_mask_land: qualitative - quantitative
    Plot the masked region.

a_diag_ts:
    Plot TS diagram at the initial and final position
    %% You can change number of the bins by a_bins
    %% ex.:>> a_bins=50.;

a_psi:
    Plot the stream function psi.
    %% You can set "a_cstep" to specify the LevelStep contour
    %% You can set "a_title" to add a comment in the title

a_psi_salt:
    Plot the stream function psi and in the background the salinity.
    It could take a long time to plot.
    %% You can set "min_transport" to plot only salinity values
    %% which have transport >= min_transport. 

a_psi_temp:
    Plot the stream function psi and in the background the temperature.
    It could take a long time to plot.
    %% You can set "min_transport" to plot only temperature values
    %% which have transport >= min_transport.

a_psi_dens:
    Plot the stream function psi and in the background the density.
    It could take a long time to plot.
    %% You can set "min_transport" to plot only density values
    %% which have transport >= min_transport.

a_psi_depth:
    Plot the stream function psi and in the background the depth.
    It could take a long time to plot.
    %% You can set "min_transport" to plot only depth values %%
    %% which have transport >= min_transport.

a_water_mass_trans:
   Compare the histograms of the temperature and salinity
   at the inital and final positions.

================
= QUALITATIVE =
================
a_mask_land: qualitative - quantitative
    Plot the masked region.

a_geo_grid: Graphic User Interface
    Useful to initialize particle positions in qualitative experiment.
    Give lon, lat, depth and this little tool answer the i,j,k positions.
    You could record the results in a file and use it in Ariane.

a_scat_all:
    Submit a_scat_temp, a_scat_salt, a_scat_dens, 
    a_scat_depth, a_scat_time.

a_scat_temp:
    Scatter-Plot of the temperature along the trajectory 
    of particules.

a_scat_salt: qualitative
    Scatter-Plot of the salinity along the trajectory 
    of particules.

a_scat_dens:
    Scatter-Plot of the density along the trajectory 
    of particules.

a_scat_depth:
    Scatter-Plot of the depth along the trajectory 
    of particules.

a_scat_time:
    Scatter-Plot of the time along the trajectory  
    of particules.

a_traj:
    Plot the trajectory of particules.
    Each trjectory has a color.

a_traj_all:
   Submit a_traj_temp, a_traj_salt, a_traj_dens, 
   a_traj_depth, a_traj_time.

a_traj_temp:
   Plot the temperature along the trajectory of particules.

a_traj_salt:
   Plot the salinity along the trajectory of particules.

a_traj_dens:
   Plot the density along the trajectory of particules.

a_traj_depth:
   Plot the depth along the trajectory of particules.

a_traj_time:
   Plot the time along the trajectory of particules.
