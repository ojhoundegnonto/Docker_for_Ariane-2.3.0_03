<h1> Introduction </h1>

<h1>ARIANE software</h1>
ARIANE is a software tool that tracks the movement of virtual particles in ocean models. It uses a special method to follow these particles in three dimensions, which helps scientists understand how water moves and mixes in the ocean. This approach is especially useful for studying different types of water masses in complex ocean circulation models
